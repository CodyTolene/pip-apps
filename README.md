Repo containing my custom applications for the PipBoy 3000 MkVI prop from The Wand Company.
To use, download the repository and move the USER and APPINFO folders into your PipBoy SD Card. 
For more information on how to access the SD card, see my [blog on the subject] (https://athene.gay/projects/pipboy.html) and [RobCo's blogposts] (https://log.robco-industries.org/documentation/pipboy-3000/#main-menu).
